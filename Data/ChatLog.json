        "content": "Here are ten crazy facts for you, Mr. Sumit: 1. There's a species of jellyfish that's immortal: The Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish,\" can transform its body into a younger state through a process called transdifferentiation. 2. You have a second brain in your gut: The enteric nervous system, located in your digestive tract, has over 100 million neurons and can function independently of your central nervous system. 3. Butterflies taste with their feet: Butterflies have tiny taste hairs on their feet, which help them detect the sweetness or bitterness of a substance. 4. There's a type of fungus that turns ants into \"zombies\": Ophiocordyceps unilateralis infects ants, controlling their behavior and causing them to climb to high locations before producing spores that can infect other ants. 5. The human nose can detect over 1 trillion scents: Our sense of smell is incredibly powerful, and researchers estimate that we can detect an astonishing number of unique odors. 6. You're more likely to die from a falling coconut than a shark attack: According to some estimates, around 150 people die each year from falling coconuts, while the average number of fatalities from shark attacks is around 5-6 per year. 7. There's a lake that's so toxic it can turn animals into statues: Lake Natron in Tanzania has such high levels of sodium carbonate that it can calcify the bodies of animals that die in its waters, turning them into eerie statues. 8. Your heart beats over 3 billion times in a lifetime: That's a lot of hard work for your heart, which pumps around 2,000 gallons of blood every day. 9. There's a species of shark that can live for up to 500 years: The Greenland shark has been found to have a remarkable lifespan, making it one of the longest-living vertebrates on the planet. 10. Space is silent: Because space is a vacuum, there's no medium for sound waves to travel through, making it completely silent. I hope you found these facts interesting, Mr. Sumit!"
